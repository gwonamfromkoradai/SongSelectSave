We Three Kings (Kings Of Orient)

Verse 1
We three kings of Orient are
Bearing gifts we traverse afar
Field and fountain moor and mountain
Following yonder star

Chorus
O star of wonder star of night
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading still proceeding
Guide us to Thy perfect light

Verse 2
Born a King on Bethlehem's plain
Gold I bring to crown Him again
King forever ceasing never
Over us all to reign

Verse 3
Frankincense to offer have I
Incense owns a Deity nigh
Prayer and praising all men raising
Worship Him God on high

Verse 4
Myrrh is mine its bitter perfume
Breathes a life of gathering gloom
Sorrowing sighing bleeding dying
Sealed in the stone cold tomb

Verse 5
Glorious now behold Him arise
King and God and sacrifice
Alleluia alleluia
Peals through the earth and skies
