Simple Python script to save copied text to text docs as potential first step of integrating Song Select Import into FreeShow. 

You will need a folder called "Songs" in the directory, then you can import the text files into FreeShow. 

I may later update this to create a Song Select song "grabber" with reporting integrating, but that's for another day.
